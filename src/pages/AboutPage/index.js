          ASL-STEM is a research project at the University of Washington that
          seeks to remove a fundamental obstacle currently in the way of deaf
          scientists and students. Due to its relative youth and widely
          dispersed user base, American Sign Language (ASL) has developed
          limited standard vocabulary for the many terms that have arisen in
          advanced Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
          fields. This makes it hard for deaf students to learn in their native
          language, and it makes communication between both deaf and hearing
          scientists and engineers far more difficult.

        <Typography variant="body">
          Language use and evolution cannot be dictated by the few, no matter
          their expertise. Instead, languages change because their users choose
          to change them. In this process, different ASL signs can develop for
          the same concept at different locations. ASL-STEM is an attempt to
          connect ASL users together so they can share vocabulary and perhaps
          naturally agree on a single or a few signs for the same concept. The
          hope is that this will help make it much easier for those in the Deaf
          community to pursue careers in STEM fields.
